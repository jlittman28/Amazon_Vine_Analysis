# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
We were tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results

## Summary
5-star vine/non-vine reviews yielded 36% and 47% respectively. This describes a negativity bias in Vine reviews. To further analyze the distribution between the two filtered dataframes, we could compare the mean, median, and mode as additional datapoints.
